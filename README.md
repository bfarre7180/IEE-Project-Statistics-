📊 **Recursion vs Iteration Performance Analysis in C++**

This project demonstrates the performance difference between recursive and iterative implementations using C++. It uses the `<chrono>` library for precise benchmarking and performs a basic statistical analysis (paired t-test) to show that recursion is slower than iteration for specific problems.

## 🧠 Overview

Recursive and iterative approaches are both widely used in problem-solving. While recursion offers elegant code, it often introduces performance overhead due to stack usage and function calls. This project benchmarks both methods and uses statistical reasoning to validate performance claims.

## 📐 Methodology

I implemented recursive and iterative versions of various simple functions like summation up to an interval:

- 10 Functions in recursive
- 10 Functions in iteration
- Each are the exact same implementation

Execution time was measured using `std::chrono` over multiple runs. We computed the average execution times for both approaches and performed a simple paired t-test to determine statistical significance.

## 🛠️ How to Build

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IEE-Project-Statistics-.git
cd IEE-Project-Statistics-
./IEEproject
```

## 📝 Results

Every time you run the program the output will be slightly different from one another but each give the same result. In one of them I got this

Now using the equations for the paired t-test we should be able to come to a conclusion, I will make a test statistic that will be able to find the p-value and I can make a two-sided confidence interval using ɑ = 1%, and the null hypothesis will be.

**Hypotheses:**

H₀: μ_D = 0  
H₁: μ_D > 0

**Test statistic:**

t₀ = **d̄** / (s_D / √n)

**Confidence Interval:**

**d̄** − t<sub>α/2, n−1</sub> × (s_D / √n) ≤ μ_D ≤ **d̄** + t<sub>α/2, n−1</sub> × (s_D / √n)
